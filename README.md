# Identitar.js

**[See the actual project here](https://leopnt.github.io/identitar.js/)**

Generates Github-like identicons from a randomly generated md5 hash.

I originally made a mistake that led to a surprising behaviour ðŸ¤— there is a tendency to create faces or body shapes.
You can also provide a custom text to get your identicon!
